Description: satuRn provides a higly performant and scalable framework for performing
    differential transcript usage analyses. The package consists of three main functions.
    The first function, fitDTU, fits quasi-binomial generalized linear models that model
    transcript usage in different groups of interest. The second function, testDTU, tests    
    for differential usage of transcripts between groups of interest. Finally, plotDTU  
    visualizes the usage profiles of transcripts in groups of interest.
Depends: R (>= 4.1)
