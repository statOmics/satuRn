satuRn is a highly performant and scalable method for performing
differential transcript usage analyses.

## Installation instructions

To install the current version of `satuRn` in Bioconductor, run;

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
 install.packages("BiocManager") 
}
BiocManager::install("satuRn")
```

To install the development version, run;

``` r
devtools::install_github("statOmics/satuRn")
```

The installation should only take a few seconds. The dependencies of the
package are listed in the DESCRIPTION file of the package.

## Issues and bug reports

Please use <https://github.com/statOmics/satuRn/issues> to submit
issues, bug reports, and comments.

## Usage

A minimal example of the different functions for `modelling`, `testing`
and `visualizing` differential transcript usage is provided.

! See the online
[vignette](https://github.com/statOmics/satuRn/blob/master/vignettes/Vignette.Rmd)
or the satuRn [website](https://statomics.github.io/satuRn/) for a more
elaborate and reproducible example.

``` r
library(satuRn)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
```

Provide a transcript expression matrix and corresponding `colData` and
`rowData`

``` r
sumExp <- SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment(
    assays = list(counts = Tasic_counts_vignette),
    colData = Tasic_metadata_vignette,
    rowData = txInfo
)

# Specify design formula from colData
metadata(sumExp)$formula <- ~ 0 + as.factor(colData(sumExp)$group)
```

Next, we test for differential transcript usage with the function
`testDTU`. This function takes as input the `SummarizedExperiment`
object generated by `fitDTU` and a contrast matrix or vector. The latter
is used to specify the comparison(s) of interest and can either be
generated manually or automatically with the `makeContrasts` function of
the `limma` R package.

``` r
group <- as.factor(Tasic_metadata_vignette$group)
design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + group) # constructs design matrix
colnames(design) <- levels(group)
L <- limma::makeContrasts(Contrast1 = VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou - ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tnc,
                          Contrast2 = VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou - ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tmem163_Dmrtb1, 
                          levels = design) # constructs contrast matrix

sumExp <- satuRn::testDTU(object = sumExp, 
                          contrasts = L, 
                          plot = FALSE, 
                          sort = FALSE)
```

The test results are now saved into the `rowData` of our
`SummarizedExperiment` object under the name `fitDTUResult_` followed by
the name of the contrast of interest (i.e. the column names of the
contrast matrix). The results can be accessed as follows:

``` r
head(rowData(sumExp)[["fitDTUResult_Contrast1"]]) # first contrast
```

Finally, we may visualize the usage of select transcripts in select
groups of interest with `plotDTU`:

``` r
sumExp <- satuRn::testDTU(
    object = sumExp,
    contrasts = L,
    plot = FALSE,
    sort = FALSE
)
```

Finally, we may visualize the usage of select transcripts in select
groups of interest with `plotDTU`:

``` r
group1 <- colnames(sumExp)[colData(sumExp)$group == "VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou"]
group2 <- colnames(sumExp)[colData(sumExp)$group == "ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tnc"]

plots <- satuRn::plotDTU(
    object = sumExp,
    contrast = "Contrast1",
    groups = list(group1, group2),
    coefficients = list(c(0, 0, 1), c(0, 1, 0)),
    summaryStat = "model",
    transcripts = c(
        "ENSMUST00000081554",
        "ENSMUST00000195963",
        "ENSMUST00000132062"
    ),
    genes = NULL,
    top.n = 6
)
```
